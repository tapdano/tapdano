  <h1 id="title">TapDano Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/13/2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>TAPDANO, LLC</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”) may collect, use, disclose, and protect information in connection with the TapDano mobile application for Android and iOS (the “<strong>App</strong>”), including features such as <strong>Seed Vault</strong>, and any related websites, in-app web views, customer support channels, and communications (together, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). This Policy is intended to be platform-agnostic and compatible, where appropriate, with major privacy frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD). It is not jurisdiction-specific and may be updated from time to time.</p>

  <p>By using the Services, you acknowledge that your information may be handled as described in this Policy, which may change as we improve or modify the Services.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1>Who We Are &amp; Scope</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Controller/Provider:</strong> TAPDANO, LLC, 7345 W Sand Lake Rd Ste 210, Orlando, FL 32819-5280, United States</li>
    <li><strong>DPO/Privacy Contact:</strong> tapdano@tapdano.com</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This Policy applies to the App and to any associated sites or communications that link to it. It does not cover third-party websites, services, wallets, exchanges, or NFC hardware/software that we do not control.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1>Definitions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means information that identifies or may reasonably be linked to an individual.</li>
    <li><strong>“Processing”</strong> means any operation performed on data (e.g., collecting, storing, using, disclosing).</li>
    <li><strong>“NFC Tag”</strong> means a near-field communication tag used to store data readable by compatible devices.</li>
    <li><strong>“Seed Phrase”</strong> (or “recovery phrase”) means a sequence of words that can restore a cryptocurrency wallet.</li>
    <li><strong>“SDKs”</strong> means software development kits or libraries from third parties that may process data on our behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>“Device Information”</strong> means technical details about the device or OS used to access the Services.</li>
    <li><strong>“Usage Data”</strong> means interaction information about how the Services are accessed and used.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h1>Information We May Collect</h1>

  <p>We aim to collect only what we need to operate and improve the Services. Specific data elements and retention periods may vary by platform and configuration.</p>

  <h2>1) Information You Provide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account or profile details (if such features are offered), preferences, and settings.</li>
    <li>Support inquiries and feedback (e.g., email address, message content, attachments).</li>
    <li>Optional survey responses or beta-testing inputs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Device &amp; Technical Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model, OS version, language, region, app version, mobile network information (where available).</li>
    <li>Mobile identifiers or resettable advertising identifiers (where enabled and permitted by platform policies).</li>
    <li>Security/diagnostic signals (e.g., crash traces, performance metrics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) App Usage Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In-app events (e.g., feature taps, screens viewed), time stamps, session length, and general interaction patterns.</li>
    <li>Aggregated analytics that help us understand trends and usability, where enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Diagnostics &amp; Crash Logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Error reports, performance logs, and related metadata to help identify, troubleshoot, and improve issues.</li>
    <li>Limited contextual information at or around the time of a crash, subject to platform capabilities and your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) High-Level NFC Interaction Metadata</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-content metadata related to NFC interactions, such as tag type/family, operation status (e.g., “write success/failure”), and approximate time stamps.</li>
    <li>This metadata is <strong>designed</strong> to be high-level and exclude seed phrase content; however, specific behavior may depend on device, OS, user actions, and configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h1>Sensitive Data Note: Seed Phrases &amp; Seed Vault</h1>

  <p>Seed phrases are <strong>highly sensitive</strong>. Seed Vault is intended to help users manage seed phrases <strong>under their control</strong>, by enabling NFC-based storage and retrieval flows designed to improve usability.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Handling:</strong> Where supported, seed phrases may be processed locally on the device and/or written to an NFC tag through platform-provided mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>No Routine Server Transmission (Design Intent):</strong> The App is <strong>not intended</strong> to collect or transmit seed phrase content to our servers in the ordinary course of operation. Actual behavior may depend on your device settings, OS-level backups, third-party services, debug modes, crash reporting configurations, or user-initiated exports/transfers.</li>
    <li><strong>Your Choices Matter:</strong> You may have options to write, read, encrypt, or backup data. The consequences of those choices (including storage on NFC tags, device keychains/secure elements, or inclusion in cloud/OS backups) may vary by platform and are outside our exclusive control.</li>
    <li><strong>Good Practices:</strong> We encourage users to follow wallet best practices and to carefully evaluate NFC tag selection, passcodes, device security, and backup configurations. No security method is perfect, and risks may remain.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h1>Purposes of Processing</h1>

  <p>We may process information for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and operate the Services:</strong> Enable core features (including NFC interactions), account or profile features (if any), and customer support.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve UX and performance:</strong> Conduct analytics, diagnostics, usability testing, and feature development.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and fraud prevention:</strong> Detect, prevent, and respond to misuse, security incidents, or harmful activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance and legal:</strong> Meet legal, regulatory, tax, or audit requirements and respond to lawful requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Send service-related messages, updates, or administrative notices. Marketing communications may be subject to consent or opt-out, as applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h1>Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h1>

  <p>Depending on your location and the activity, we may rely on different legal bases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For certain analytics, optional features, or marketing (where required).</li>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> To provide features you request and to perform our agreement with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To operate, secure, and improve the Services in a balanced way that respects your rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> Where processing is necessary to comply with applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h1>Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties / SDKs</h1>

  <p>We may share information with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers / SDKs:</strong> For analytics, crash reporting, customer support tools, cloud hosting, content delivery, authentication, and similar operational services. These providers may process Device Information, Usage Data, and diagnostics to deliver their services.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, insolvency, or sale of assets, subject to customary safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal &amp; Compliance:</strong> To comply with law, legal process, or government requests, and to protect rights, property, users, or the public.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregated/De-identified Data:</strong> We may share aggregated statistics that do not reasonably identify individuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not intend to “sell” Personal Data or “share” it for cross-context behavioral advertising as those terms may be defined in certain laws; if our practices change, we may provide additional notices or opt-out mechanisms, where required.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1>International Data Transfers</h1>

  <p>Where information is transferred to countries that may not offer the same level of data protection as your home jurisdiction, we may use <strong>appropriate safeguards</strong> (e.g., standard contractual clauses or similar mechanisms) or rely on your consent, where applicable. Actual transfer mechanisms may vary based on the services and providers used over time.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1>Data Retention</h1>

  <p>We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, taking into account legal, tax, and operational considerations.</p>
